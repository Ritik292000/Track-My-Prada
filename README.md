# Track-My-Prada

## What is "Where is My Prada?"

"Where is My Prada?" is a platform built on **Hyperledger Fabric** designed to track the complete journey of a Prada product.

Consumers can view the product’s lifecycle from raw material sourcing to final delivery. The platform provides transparency and trust by capturing key data points such as:

- **Origin of production**
- **Product verification**
- **Personalized assignment based on customer requirements**
- **Sustainability and ethical sourcing information**

This ensures a transparent supply chain for ethically sourced products — benefiting both brands and consumers.
